how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 15 or 16 - unsure because I was late on the assignment. Game works as expected and is fully functional.

## Self-Reflection:
This was an assignment that took more time than previous ones. I was stuck on some of the functions, the comments were in depth enough to walk me through it to get everything working. It was a fun assignment and it feels great to complete.
